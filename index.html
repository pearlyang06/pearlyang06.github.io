    <h3>Get to know me</h3>
    <p>Hello my name is Pearl, and I am 19 years old. I enjoy many things in life, and I am going to share some of those things with u guys, along with some things that I will like to do in the future.</p>

      <div class="travel ">
        <div class="places">
          <h4>Travel</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>One of the many things that I like to do is travel. My family and I go on adventures all the time, and it is always so fun no matter where we go. I love going down south to LA or Long Beach becuse I love the ocean and all of the many new things to try down there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="food">
          <h4>Food</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>What is traveling without trying new food? My favorite thing to do is trying new foods. It's always so fun to try new things. Espeically if you are a foodie like me. Some of my favorite foods are tacos, pasta, boba, and seafood. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="movies">
          <h4>Movies</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>Another thing that I like to do is watch movies. Watching movies with friends and family is always fun and a good way to bring everyone together in the same room. My favorite movie right now will probably be Avengers Infinity War. I am a big Marvel fan and have seen every Marvel movie there is and I can't wait for Endgame.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="travel">
          <h4>Travel Plan</h4>
          <h5></h5>
          <p>As I mention before, I like to travel, but I never been in another country. So my future plan is to travel out of country and visit my parents home country. I want to travel everywhere, but my top 3 travel destination are Thailand, Canada, and France.</p>
